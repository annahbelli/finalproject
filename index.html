					<h2><strong>Doctors Who Diagnosed Shaken Baby Syndrome Now Defend the Acused</strong></h2>
					<p>Debbie Cenziper, Lauryn Schroeder, Sophia Bollag and Anna Zambelli</p>
					<p>The Washington Post</p>
					<p class="story">The forensic pathologist who had spent the better part of 30 years investigating violent deaths walked into a Minnesota courtroom in 2012, braced to testify at another grueling murder trial.
					<br><br>
					Jonathan Arden quickly took stock of the case: A 4-month-old boy had collapsed in his father’s care and died from lethal head injuries. Damien Marsden, 33, faced decades in prison, accused of shaking the baby to death.
					<br><br>
					Once, Arden had been a firm believer in Shaken Baby Syndrome, long considered a deadly form of child abuse. But in rural Warren, Minn., in April 2012, the former state expert took the stand for the defense, describing how a thin layer of old blood on the surface of the baby’s brain was a telltale sign of an injury that had occurred before the baby had been left alone with his father.</p>

					<h2><strong>Deliverance From 27,000 Feet</strong></h2>
					<p>John Brand</p>
					<p>The New York Times</p>
					<p class="story">
						Five Sherpas surrounded the frozen corpse. They swung axes at the body’s edges, trying to pry it from its icy tomb. They knocked chunks of snow from the body, and the shattered pieces skittered down the mountain. When they finally freed a leg and lifted it, the entire stiff and contorted body shifted, down to its fingertips.
						<br><br>
						The sun was shining, but the air was dangerously cold and thin at 27,300 feet above sea level. A plume of snow clouded the ridge toward the summit of Mount Everest, so close above. When the Sherpas arrived — masks on their faces, oxygen tanks on their backs — the only movement on the steep face came from the dead man’s frayed jacket pockets. They were inside out and flapping in the whipping wind.
						<br><br>
						More than a year of exposure to the world’s wickedest elements had blackened and shriveled the man’s bare face and hands. His hydrant-yellow summit suit had dulled to the hue of a fallen leaf. The bottom of his boots pointed uphill. His frozen arms were bent at the elbows and splayed downhill over his head. It was as if the man sat down for a rest, fell backward and froze that way.

		<h1 class="subhead">Recipe: Buttery Sourdough Buns</h1>

		<h2>I found this recipe recently when feeding my new sourdough starter for the first time. I love it because you can easily put unfed starter to good use with ingredients from your pantry! I converted the recipe to weights because it's more accurate and makes for fewer dirty dishes.</h2>
		<div class="ingredients">

			<img src="images/buns.jpg" alt="Buttery Sourdough Buns">

			<h2>Ingredients</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>120g sourdough starter, ripe (fed) or discard</li>
				<li>361g all-purpose flour</li>
				<li>2 1/2 teaspoons instant yeast</li>
				<li>14g sugar</li>
				<li>1 1/4 teaspoons salt</li>
				<li>1 large egg</li>
				<li>71g soft butter</li>
				<li>152g lukewarm water</li>
				<li>57g melted butter, divided</li>
				<li>1/4 teason paprika, optional (but highly recommended for color!)</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<div class="instructions">
			<h2>Instructions</h2>
			<ol>
				<li>Combine all of the dough ingredients in a large bowl, and mix and knead — using your hands, a stand mixer, or a bread machine set on the dough cycle — to make a soft, smooth dough. For me, about five minutes on low speed in the stand mixer did the trick.</li>
				<li>Place the dough in a lightly greased container and allow the dough to rise for 1 1/2 to 2 hours, until it's just about doubled in bulk. I kept mine in the fridge for about 6 hours for a slower rise to deepen the sourdough flavor - and to run some errands!</li>
				<li>Gently deflate the dough, and transfer it to a lightly greased work surface.</li>
				<li>Roll and pat the dough into a rough rectangle approximately 12" x 16". Put 2 tablespoons melted butter in a small bowl, and add the paprika, if desired; it's there for color, and accentuates the buns' swirl, but omit it if you wish. Spread the dough with the melted butter.</li>
				<li>Starting with a long side, roll the dough into a log.</li>
				<li>Cut the log in 1" slices, using a sharp knife, or a piece of dental floss looped between your fingers.</li>
				<li>Lightly grease two 8" or 9" round cake pans. Arrange 8 buns in each pan.</li>
				<li>Cover the pans, and let the buns rise for 60 minutes, until they're noticeably puffy. Don't let these buns rise too long; you want them to have enough rising power left to expand nicely in the oven. Towards the end of the rising time, preheat the oven to 350°F.</li>
				<li>Uncover the pans, and brush each bun with some of the remaining melted butter.</li>
				<li>Bake the buns for 22 to 25 minutes; they'll color only slightly.</li>
				<li>Remove the buns from the oven, and turn them out of the pan onto a rack. Brush with any remaining melted butter. Serve hot or warm. To reheat, place the buns on a baking sheet, tent lightly with aluminum foil, and bake for 10 minutes in a preheated 350°F oven.</li>
				<li>Wrap any leftover buns airtight, and store at room temperature for several days. For longer storage, wrap airtight and freeze.</li>

		<!-- Peru Itinerary -->

	<div class="peru-holder hide holder clearfix">
		<h1 class="subhead">Itinerary: Peru in Two Weeks</h1>
		<h2>Day 1: Travel</h2>
			<p>
				Depending on where you are coming from, traveling will likely take you the majority of the first day. Upon arrival in Lima, make sure to use one of the certified taxi services to get to your hotel (we used Taxi Green).
			</p>
			<p>
				For accomodation in Lima, <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g294316-d7044992-Reviews-Hotel_Casa_Cielo-Lima_Lima_Region.html" target="_blank">Casa Cielo</a> in the Miraflores neighborhood is reasonably priced, well-kept and in a great location. If you arrive in time, consider heading out to the Miraflores boardwalk for sunset or taking a stroll in Parque Kennedy. 
		<h2>Day 2: Lima</h2>
			<img src="images/lima.jpg" alt="Lima City Centre" class="right">
			<p>
				To pack Lima into one day, start out with the daytime food tour from <a href="https://www.limagourmetcompany.com/lima-food-tour-day.html" target="_blank">The Lima Gourmet Company</a>. Your guide will pick you up from your hotel and then you will explore the Miraflores, Barranco & San Isidro districts while sampling local delicacies. We particularly enjoyed making ceviche and pisco sours during the cooking class part of the tour. The tour ends with a big meal at the Huaca Pucllana ruins - definitely come hungry!
			</p>
			<p>
				We were still fairly jet-lagged at this point and spent the afternoon walking around Miraflores near our hotel. If you have more energy, you could explore the popular <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g294316-d311651-Reviews-Museo_Larco-Lima_Lima_Region.html" target="_blank">Museo Larco</a> or head into the City Centre for a self-guided historical tour.
			</p>
			<p>
				For dinner, we ended up eating at <a href="http://www.astridygaston.com/" target="_blank">Astrid y Gaston</a>, one of Lima's oldest upscale dining options with the famous Gaston Acurio as head chef. We unsuccessfully tried to get a reservation at <a href="http://centralrestaurante.com.pe/en/" target="_blank">Central</a>, recently named the 4th best restaurant in the world. While Astrid was very good, it has been consistently falling on the world's best restaurants list. Try to get in at Central if possible!
			</p>
			<p>
				For less expensive and extravagent options, <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g294316-d7095890-Reviews-Barrio-Lima_Lima_Region.html" target="_blank">Barrio</a>, <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g294316-d1943020-Reviews-Quimera_Restaurante-Lima_Lima_Region.html" target="_blank">Quimera</a> or <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g294316-d789641-Reviews-Malabar-Lima_Lima_Region.html" target="_blank">Malabar</a> may be good options.
			</p>
		<h2>Day 3: Lima - Cusco</h2>
			<img src="images/ninos.jpg" alt="Ninos Hotel in Cusco" class="left">
			<p>
				On Day 3, wake up and head to the airport after breakfast. The flight from Lima to Cusco is inexpensive and much quicker than trying to take a bus through the mountains!
			</p>
			<p>
				Upon arrival in Cusco, remember that you're likely going to need some time to acclimate to the altitude. At 15,000 feet, I'd highly recommend consulting a doctor about altitude sickness medication options. I definitely underestimated how this would feel and didn't plan enough time to rest.
			</p>
			<p>
				Get a taxi and head to the <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g294314-d316205-Reviews-Ninos_Hotel-Cusco_Cusco_Region.html" target="_blank">Ninos Hotel</a>. I cannot recommend this charming, centrally located boutique hotel highly enough. There is a small restaurant inside with delicious soups and great breakfast options. They'll store your luggage while you head to Macchu Picchu, as most hotels in Cusco will.
			</p>
			<p>
				Take this day to explore Cusco as you're up for it. Walking around the Plaza De Armas & San Blas was plenty for us. However, if you want to get your first look at Inca Ruins and are up for the walking, <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g294314-d311726-Reviews-Sacsayhuaman-Cusco_Cusco_Region.html" target="_blank">Sacsayhuaman</a> is a great option for today.
			</p>
		<h2>Day 4: Cusco & The Sacred Valley</h2>
			<img src="images/maras.jpg" alt="Maras Salt Mines" class="right">
			<p>
				Today, you can either continue exploring Cusco, or head into the Sacred Valley. We opted to take an ATV tour through the Sacred Valley that stopped at the Moray archaeological site and the Maras salt mines.
			</p>
			<p>
				For seeing Machu Picchu during this short trip, there are a few options. We had planned to do a 1-day hike on the Inca Trail (with one overnight in Aguas Calientes) through <a href="http://www.sastravelperu.com/english/" target="_blank">SAS Travel</a>. Due to the altitude sickness, we ended up opting out of the hike and meeting our group in Aguas Calientes. I recommend using a company like SAS regardless if you want to hike to deal with securing permits and train travel. However, you can book this on your own.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you are traveling with a company, you will likely have an orientation in the evening and then you'll want to get to bed early to prepare for a very early pickup in the morning.
			</p>
		<h2>Day 5: Machu Picchu</h2>
			<p>
				On Day 5, you'll head to Peru's iconic Machu Picchu. In our case, we were picked up from our hotel at 4 a.m. for a bus ride to the train into Aguas Calientes (hikers get off the train a little sooner). 
			</p>
			<p>
				If you don't hike, you'll spend the day in Aguas Calientes. There's not much to see here and it can easily be fully explored in a half day.
			</p>
			<p>
				You'll likely want to head to bed early again to prepare for Machu Picchu tomorrow.
			</p>
		<h2>Day 6: Machu Picchu - Cusco</h2>
			<img src="images/machu.jpg" alt="Machu Picchu" class="left">
			<p>
				Every day, Machu Picchu adventurers line up very early to get on the buses that go up the mountain. There's also an option to hike up the mountain, but you'll want to save your energy if you're planning to climb Huayna Picchu or Mount Machu Picchu later in the day.
			</p>
			<p>
				We opted for the popular <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g294318-d548890-Reviews-Huayna_Picchu-Machu_Picchu_Sacred_Valley_Cusco_Region.html" target="_blank">Huayna Picchu</a> hike and found it very challenging but rewarding and worthwhile! You'll have to purchase a permit with a specific time well in advance to secure this hike.
			</p>
			<p>
				Having a guided tour of the rest of the ruins turned out to be really important as well. If you aren't traveling with a company like SAS, there are day guides you can hire for a relatively reasonable rate.
			</p>
			<p>
				After you've seen the whole site, you'll head back to Aguas Calientes for lunch before heading back to Cusco and collapsing in exhaustion. If you're up for dinner, <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g294314-d4059500-Reviews-LIMO_cocina_peruana_pisco_bar-Cusco_Cusco_Region.html" target="_blank">Limo</a> is a great option to celebrate a big day of exploring.
			</p>
		<h2>Day 7: Travel Day</h2>
			<img src="images/buggy.jpg" alt="Dune Buggy" class="right">
			<p>
				After sleeping in a little to recover from hiking, head back to the airport to catch a return flight to Lima. Upon arrival in Lima, you'll head to the Javier Prado bus station to catch a luxury ride (think Megabus with big comfy recliners) to the desert. The 4-hour trip brings you to Ica, where you'll need to grab a taxi to the tiny desert oasis of Huacachina.
			</p>
			<p>
				We opted for the Huacachina's nicest hotel, <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-s1-g304038-d943041-Reviews-Hotel_El_Huacachinero-Huacachina_Ica_Region.html" target="_blank">El Huacachinero</a>. It was still only $95/night in the busy season and had air conditioning and a lovely pool. After the fast pace of the previous week, relaxing at the pool was a necessary part of the last leg.
			</p>
			<p>
				There are extremely limited dining options in this area. You can walk around the whole oasis in about 7 minutes and scope them all out.
			</p>
		<h2>Day 8: Huacachina</h2>
			<p>
				After spending the day at the pool, take a sunset dune buggy tour from one of the many operators in the area. You'll have the chance to try sandboarding as well as explore the sandy dunes without the sun blaring down.
			</p>
			<p>
				Head to bed at a reasonable time for another early morning.
			</p>
		<h2>Day 9: Nazca Lines</h2>
			<img src="images/plane.jpg" alt="Small Plane" class="left">
			<p>
				This morning you'll fly over the famous Nazca lines, a series of ancient, mysterious geoglyphs. Historians are unsure how they were formed and what purpose they served. The best way to see them in all their glory is by plane!
			</p>
			<p>
				Since you are already in Ica, I recommend taking a flight from the Ica airport rather than taking a 2-hour bus to Nazca and flying from there. This option is more expensive and you may choose to go to Nazca if you have more time. Be sure to research reputable airlines and book on a responsible carrier.
			</p>
			<p>
				After the flight, head back to the bus station and get a ticket to Paracas (about 45 mins away). Check into the <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g445063-d6620568-Reviews-Bamboo_Lodge_Paracas-Paracas_Ica_Region.html" target="_blank">Bamboo Lodge</a> and make sure to request and ocean-facing balcony. There are several great seafood options nearby for dinner.
			</p>
		<h2>Day 10: Islas Ballestas - Lima - Home</h2>
			<img src="images/bamboo.jpg" alt="View of the Ocean" class="right">
			<p>
				Head down to the marina first thing in the morning and sign up for a tour of the Islas Ballestas. You'll see sea lions, birds and more ancient geoglyphs!
			</p>
			<p>
				After the boat tour, check out of the hotel and grab lunch. Head back to the bus station and get on a bus back to Lima.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you stayed at Casa Cielo, you can store your bag there for the evening. We used this time to explore the city centre of Lima but you can use it for anything you may have missed in Lima at the beginning! After dinner, grab your bags and head to the airport for an overnight flight home.
